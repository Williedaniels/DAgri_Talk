# D'Agri Talk - Infrastructure as Code

This directory contains Terraform configurations for provisioning the complete AWS infrastructure for the D'Agri Talk Traditional Agricultural Knowledge Platform.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The infrastructure is designed with the following principles:

- **Modular Design**: Reusable modules for different components
- **Environment Separation**: Separate configurations for dev/staging/prod
- **Security First**: Private subnets, security groups, encrypted storage
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment with load balancing
- **Cost Optimization**: Right-sized resources for each environment

```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **AWS CLI configured** with appropriate credentials
2. **Terraform installed** (version >= 1.0)
3. **Appropriate IAM permissions** for resource creation

### Development Environment Deployment

```bash
# Navigate to development environment
cd terraform/environments/dev

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Review the plan
terraform plan

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply
```

## Production Environment Deployment

```sh
# Navigate to production environment
cd terraform/environments/prod

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Review the plan
terraform plan

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply
```

## üîß Module Documentation

### Networking Module

Creates the foundational network infrastructure:

- VPC with DNS support

- Public subnets for load balancers

- Private subnets for applications and databases

- Internet Gateway for public internet access

- NAT Gateways for private subnet internet access

- Security Groups for application, database, and load balancer

### Database Module

Provisions a managed PostgreSQL database:

- RDS PostgreSQL with encryption at rest

- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability (production)

- Automated backups with configurable retention

- Parameter groups for performance optimization

- Secrets Manager integration for credential management

### Container Registry Module

Sets up container image repositories:

- ECR repositories for backend and frontend images

- Lifecycle policies for image cleanup

- Image scanning for security vulnerabilities

- Encryption for stored images

## üîê Security Features

- Private Subnets: Applications and databases in private subnets

- Security Groups: Least-privilege network access

- Encryption: At-rest encryption for databases and container images

- Secrets Management: Database credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager

- IAM Roles: Service-specific IAM roles with minimal permissions

## üìä Monitoring and Logging

- CloudWatch Logs: Centralized logging for all services

- CloudWatch Metrics: Performance and health monitoring

- RDS Enhanced Monitoring: Database performance insights

- Container Insights: ECS task and service monitoring

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

### Development Environment

- t3.micro RDS instance (free tier eligible)

- Minimal storage allocation

- Single AZ deployment

- Shorter backup retention

### Production Environment

- Multi-AZ RDS deployment

- Enhanced monitoring enabled

- Longer backup retention

- Performance Insights enabled

## üîÑ State Management

For production use, configure remote state storage:

```txt
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "dagri-talk-terraform-state"
    key            = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "dagri-talk-terraform-locks"
  }
}
```

## üìù Variables

Key variables that can be customized:

| Variable              | Description                    | Default         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------- |
| `project_name`        | Name of the project            | `dagri-talk`    |
| `environment`         | Environment name               | `dev`           |
| `region`              | AWS region                     | `us-east-1`     |
| `vpc_cidr`            | VPC CIDR block                 | `10.0.0.0/16`   |
| `db_instance_class`   | RDS instance type              | `db.t3.micro`   |
| `enable_monitoring`   | Enable enhanced monitoring     | `true`          |

## üéØ Outputs

Important outputs from the infrastructure:

- VPC and Subnet IDs: For application deployment

- Database Endpoint: For application configuration

- ECR Repository URLs: For container image pushing

- Security Group IDs: For additional resource configuration

## üö® Important Notes

1. State File Security: Never commit terraform.tfstate files

2. Secrets Management: Use AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data

3. Resource Tagging: All resources are tagged for cost tracking

4. Environment Isolation: Each environment has separate state files

## üîß Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

1. Insufficient IAM Permissions

2. State Lock Issues

3. Resource Conflicts
