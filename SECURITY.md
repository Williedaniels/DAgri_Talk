# Security Policy

## üîí D'Agri Talk Security Framework

This document outlines the security policies and procedures for the D'Agri Talk Traditional Agricultural Knowledge Platform.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth

- Multiple layers of security controls
- Comprehensive vulnerability scanning
- Automated security monitoring
- Regular security assessments

### 2. Shift-Left Security

- Security integrated into development process
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Early vulnerability detection and remediation
- Security-focused code reviews

### 3. Continuous Monitoring

- Real-time security monitoring
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Security incident response procedures
- Regular security audits

## üîç Security Scanning

### Automated Security Scans

Our DevSecOps pipeline includes:

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: CodeQL analysis
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety (Python), npm audit (Node.js)
- **Container Security**: Trivy, Snyk vulnerability scanning
- **Secrets Detection**: TruffleHog, GitLeaks scanning
- **Infrastructure Security**: Checkov Terraform analysis
- **Code Quality**: Bandit (Python), ESLint Security (JavaScript)

### Scan Frequency

- **Pull Requests**: All security scans run automatically
- **Daily Scans**: Scheduled comprehensive security analysis
- **Dependency Updates**: Weekly automated dependency updates
- **Manual Scans**: On-demand security assessments

## üö® Vulnerability Management

### Severity Classification

- **Critical**: Immediate action required (0-24 hours)
- **High**: Action required within 7 days
- **Medium**: Action required within 30 days
- **Low**: Action required within 90 days

### Response Procedures

1. **Detection**: Automated scanning identifies vulnerabilities
2. **Assessment**: Security team evaluates impact and severity
3. **Remediation**: Patches applied or mitigations implemented
4. **Verification**: Fixes validated through testing
5. **Documentation**: Incident documented and lessons learned

## üîê Security Controls

### Application Security

- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization controls
- Secure session management
- HTTPS encryption for all communications
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection

### Infrastructure Security

- Network segmentation and firewalls
- Encrypted data storage and transmission
- Access controls and least privilege principles
- Regular security updates and patches
- Monitoring and logging
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

### Container Security

- Minimal base images
- Non-root user execution
- Regular image updates
- Vulnerability scanning
- Runtime security monitoring
- Secure container orchestration

## üìã Security Compliance

### Standards and Frameworks

- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- AWS Security Best Practices
- Container Security Guidelines
- DevSecOps best practices

### Regular Assessments

- Monthly security reviews
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Annual security audits
- Continuous compliance monitoring

## üöÄ Incident Response

### Response Team

- Security Lead: Primary incident coordinator
- Development Team: Technical remediation
- Operations Team: Infrastructure response
- Management: Communication and decisions

### Response Process

1. **Detection and Analysis**: Identify and assess security incidents
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems and prevent spread
3. **Eradication**: Remove threats and vulnerabilities
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems and validate security
5. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve processes

## üìû Reporting Security Issues

### Internal Reporting

- Security incidents: <security@dagri-talk.com>
- Vulnerability reports: <vulnerabilities@dagri-talk.com>
- Emergency contact: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX

### External Reporting

We welcome responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities:

1. Email: <security@dagri-talk.com>
2. Include detailed description and reproduction steps
3. Allow reasonable time for investigation and remediation
4. Avoid public disclosure until issue is resolved

## üèÜ Security Recognition

We appreciate security researchers who help improve our platform:

- Acknowledgment in security advisories
- Recognition in our security hall of fame
- Potential bug bounty rewards (future program)

## üìö Security Resources

### Training and Awareness

- Regular security training for development team
- Security best practices documentation
- Incident response procedures
- Security tool usage guides

### Documentation

- Security architecture diagrams
- Threat modeling documentation
- Security testing procedures
- Compliance checklists
